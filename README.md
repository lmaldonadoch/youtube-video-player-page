# youtube-video-player-page

This is a YouTbe website clone without the functionality but with all the elements showing. It has an embedded video that plays and shows the title. We applied all the styling, including the fonts, to make it look as similar as possible without using any Javascript. We used external sourcess like www.fontawesome.com to add the icons and Google Fonts to make it look just like it.
